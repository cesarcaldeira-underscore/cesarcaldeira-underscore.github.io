  üëãüèª Hi, I'm C√©sar! I like writing and sharing my interests (which will likely bore you to oblivion).

I'm currently a graduate student in political science and international relations (specialising in security and defence) at the Catholic University of Portugal. Besides that, I have a background in computer science and game development, an unhealthy relation with chess, and a voracious taste for listening to the news (mostly while showering).

I started out **Underscore_** as a project in early 2024 as a way to share my projects and passions, separated in a blog (['The Archives'](/archives/)) which I write more or less frequently and a section with selected [projects](/projects/) I work on (usually university stuff, but other things might pop up on occasion).

Feel free to leave a contribution on my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/underscore_cc) if you like my work. It would help out a lot in paying for my studies and expanding this project into something bigger!

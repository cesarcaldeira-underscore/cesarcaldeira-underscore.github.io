  A collection of projects I submited during my time in university.

This is the homepage for my university projects which I deem decent enough to publish on this site. Though I did study for three years in the field of computer science, this page is dedicated to those projects associated with my studies in political science and international relations (on which I currently hold a BA from the Catholic University of Portugal's Institute for Political studies, and am further pursuing an MA at the same institution, specialising in security and defence).

Ever since I enrolled in my Masters' degree in Political Science and International Relations, specialising in security and defence, I have had the chance to study a great deal about China. The following are some of the essays I produced on defence policy, military history, and strategy focused on China and its neighbours.

As a result of these investigations, I have decided to focus my studies on Asian security and am in the process of seeking further education in Asian Studies to complement my background in political science and international relations.

Australia's [National Defence Review 2023](https://www.defence.gov.au/about/reviews-inquiries/defence-strategic-review) (NDR23) is the nation's chief strategic document. Its stated aims are *"to provide a strategic assessment and a far-reaching strategy for the nation and the Government, as well as a roadmap for* [the Department of] *Defence to implement our* [the authors'] *recommendations."*

## Summary of NDR23

### Australia's strategic circumstances

- Australia perceives the region in which it is located (the Indo-Pacific) to be the gravitational centre of an escalating **major power strategic competition**. This competition is headed by:
  - The **United States of America**: the *former* unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific, and chief defence partner of Australia;
  - And the **People's Republic of China**: the revisionist challenger to America's regional (and global) leadership, and Australia's main economic partner.

- Climate change, a "recent" addition to the challenges Australia faces, is a factor that Australia's Department of Defence considers important, especially considering the **increased humanitarian and disaster relief efforts** it must undertake.

### Defence as a "whole-of-government" endeavour

Australia is going through a doctrinal shift in its defence policy:

- The old doctrine of *Defence of Australia* aimed to **deter and respond to potential low-level threats from small and middle powers**.
- This has been updated to a ***National Defence*** doctrine which considers **growing threats which greaty challenge the regional balance of power** and requires **a "whole-of-government" and "whole-of-nation" approach to security**, meaning placing security and defence at the forefront of policy development and international engagement.

### Alliances and defence partnerships

Australia's security has long been dependent on allies and partners. Chief among these, however, is the **alliance with the United States** (which is notably always capitalised when mentioned in official documents). Australia aims to have greater **US forces rotating in the region**, increased **technological and industrial information exchanges**, and to obtain (on the long term) **greater capabilities** from the US, with a **focus on submarine and missile forces** (through AUKUS) that can **expand its maritime strategic depth**.

### Force design and structure

Australia reckons the ADF's (Australian Defence Force) **current tools and institutional architecture are inadequate for the new strategic environment** it operates in. A key aspect of the reforms it aims to achieve is to transform the ADF into a "genuine *Integrated Force*", meaning it can **operate seemlessly across all domains of warfare and in multi-national operations**.

Some selected capabilities critical to this new ADF approach's operational success:

### Workforce, capability acquisition, and finance

Important considerations on materiel acquisition, workforce retention, and finance:

- NDR23 recognises current **shortcomings in ADF and public service workforces**. To overcome these challenges, **pay and service conditions are being revamped in order to avoid a brain-drain** in the defence sector.
- A new policy of acquisition is being implemented. Previous acquisition philosophies emphasised getting the best materiel via complex processes. This led to a state of affairs in which procurement takes too long and often cannot deliver in scale. The new philosophy moves away from this and is based on **"minimum viable capability in the shortest possible time"**.
- Financing is to undergo significant transformation and reprioritisation. **Trade-offs are necessary both within the Defence budget** — re-focusing efforts — **and on the national finances' side**. The **new strategic circumstance requires an increased investment that may need to be implemented faster than the budgetary shock it represents can subside**.

  **Notice:** AUKUS and US investment and technology sharing agreedments have the potential to add greatly to Australia's economy and workforce, ameliorating possible budgetary and economic shocks.
